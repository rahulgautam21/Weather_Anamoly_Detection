# Weather_Anamoly_Detection
Predicting anomalies in the weather sensor data using machine learning

Used different machine models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and KNN) for predicting weather anamolies on NC State Climate Data.

The main challlenge with the data is that only 3% of the readings are erroneous.
